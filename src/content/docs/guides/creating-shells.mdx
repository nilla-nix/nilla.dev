Similar to `inputs`, Nilla uses a system of `builders` to create shells. A builder provides
a `build` function and `settings` options to configure its use. Out of the box, Nilla ships with
a single builder, `nixpkgs`. This builder is used to create shells using Nixpkgs' `callPackage`
functionality. This guide will show you how to create a new shell using the `nixpkgs` builder,
but remember that you can create your own builders as well!

<Aside type="note">
  This guide will assume you have a Nilla project created and a Nixpkgs pin available.

## Create a new shell

To create a new shell, we need to define two options: the `systems` that the shell will be
built for and the `shell` function that will produce the built shell.

<Code lang="nix" code={shell0Code} title="my-shell.nix" />

This shell can now be built using the Nilla CLI.

```bash
nilla shell my-shell
```

<Aside type="tip">
  If you name your shell `default` then you can run `nilla shell` on its own to use it!
</Aside>

## Using a custom package set

By default, the Nixpkgs builder will use the package set produced by `inputs.nixpkgs` if it
exists. However, we can also specify the package set manually in our shell definition.

<Code lang="nix" code={shell1Code} title="my-shell.nix" />

## Customizing shell arguments

The `shell` function takes its arguments from Nixpkgs' `callPackage` function in addition to
`settings`. This allows us to override or provide additional configuration.

<Code lang="nix" code={shell2Code} title="my-shell.nix" />
