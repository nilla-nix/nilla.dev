Similar to `inputs`, Nilla uses a system of `builders` to create packages. A builder provides
a `build` function and `settings` options to configure its use. Out of the box, Nilla ships with
a single builder, `nixpkgs`. This builder is used to create packages using Nixpkgs' `callPackage`
functionality. This guide will show you how to create a new package using the `nixpkgs` builder,
but remember that you can create your own builders as well!

<Aside type="note">
  This guide will assume you have a Nilla project created and a Nixpkgs pin available.

## Create a new package

To create a new package, we need to define two options: the `systems` that the package will be
built for and the `package` function that will produce the built package.

<Code lang="nix" code={package0Code} title="my-package.nix" />

This package can now be built using the Nilla CLI.

```bash
nilla build my-package
```

<Aside type="tip">
  If you name your package `default` then you can run `nilla build` on its own to build it!
</Aside>

## Using a custom package set

By default, the Nixpkgs builder will use the package set produced by `inputs.nixpkgs` if it
exists. However, we can also specify the package set manually in our package definition.

<Code lang="nix" code={package1Code} title="my-package.nix" />

## Customizing package arguments

The `package` function takes its arguments from Nixpkgs' `callPackage` function in addition to
`settings`. This allows us to override or provide additional configuration.

<Code lang="nix" code={package2Code} title="my-package.nix" />
